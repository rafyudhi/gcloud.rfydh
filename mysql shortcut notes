How to Get the Size of a Table in MySQL

SELECT
  TABLE_NAME AS `Table`,
  ROUND((DATA_LENGTH + INDEX_LENGTH) / 1024 / 1024) AS `Size (MB)`
FROM
  information_schema.TABLES
WHERE
  TABLE_SCHEMA = "bookstore"
ORDER BY
  (DATA_LENGTH + INDEX_LENGTH)
DESC;

+----------------------------------+-----------+
| Table                            | Size (MB) |
+----------------------------------+-----------+
| book                             |       267 |
| author                           |        39 |
| post                             |        27 |
| cache                            |        24 |
...


SELECT
  TABLE_NAME AS `Table`,
  ROUND((DATA_LENGTH + INDEX_LENGTH) / 1024 / 1024) AS `Size (MB)`
FROM
  information_schema.TABLES
WHERE
    TABLE_SCHEMA = "bookstore"
  AND
    TABLE_NAME = "book"
ORDER BY
  (DATA_LENGTH + INDEX_LENGTH)
DESC;

The results, as expected, are now:

+-------+-----------+
| Table | Size (MB) |
+-------+-----------+
| book  |       267 |
+-------+-----------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)


List All Table Sizes From ALL Databases
If you’re running into an issue where your database is growing in size but you don’t know which table is the culprit, it may be useful to query for the size of all tables within all databases in the entire system. This can be accomplished easily with the following query:

SELECT
  TABLE_SCHEMA AS `Database`,
  TABLE_NAME AS `Table`,
  ROUND((DATA_LENGTH + INDEX_LENGTH) / 1024 / 1024) AS `Size (MB)`
FROM
  information_schema.TABLES
ORDER BY
  (DATA_LENGTH + INDEX_LENGTH)
DESC;
This will return not only the size of the table, but also the table name and parent database it is associated with.
